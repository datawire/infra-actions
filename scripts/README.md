# GitHub Actions Time

A simple python script that pulls data from the GitHub Actions API and does some basic analysis to help
you understand how long your workflows are taking to run.

Right now it has a single command but this could be expanded if we wanted to know more in the future.

Run it with Python 3.11, as of now all requirements are in the standard library.
